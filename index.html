            <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 
                It allows businesses and individuals to store and process data in third-party data centers, rather than on local servers or personal computers, providing a more scalable and cost-effective solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cloud computing services can be divided into three main categories: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
                These services allow users to outsource their computing needs, leading to reduced IT costs, increased efficiency, and the ability to scale resources as needed. 
                Popular examples of cloud services include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
